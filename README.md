# ProjektKomunikator

<h3>Komunikator</h3>
<p>Simple instant messaging service</p>
<hr>
<p>Group school project.
<br>We tried to make instant messaging service. We tried to do it with sockets. It's very primitive and kind of works.
<br>Documantation was more important than the software itself so any enthusiasm about the project died. Well the documentation also wasn't important in this course. At the end I don't think I should care if teacher have no idea what he wants to teach.
<br>On the bright side mobile client looks kind of nice and I learnt how to host server app on Amazon AWS.
